## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap Framework



### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div container using properties like display, align-items, justify-content.

### Continued development

i would like to focus much on user interactivity part, features like buttons, animations among others



### Useful resources

- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This helped me get the font called outfit. I really liked this because it has a range of the font-weight which can be of importance.
- [Bootstrap CSS Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This is an amazing tool to get inbuilt css styles which helped me finally understand on how to link them with html and how i can use it on code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
